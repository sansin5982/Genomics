# DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)

## Introduction

DNA is the hereditary material in almost all living organisms. It
carries genetic instructions for growth, development, functioning, and
reproduction. It is a long molecule made up of nucleotides, forming a
double helix structure.

## History of DNA Discovery

### 1. Early Theories of Heredity

Before DNA was identified as the genetic material, scientists believed
proteins carried genetic information due to their complexity.

### 2. Key Discoveries

-   **1869 - Friedrich Miescher**: Isolated a substance from white blood
    cells, called “nuclein,” later identified as DNA.
-   **1928 - Frederick Griffith**: Conducted experiments with bacteria
    (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and discovered the **“transforming
    principle.”**
-   **1944 - Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty**:
    Identified DNA as the transforming principle.
-   **1952 - Hershey & Chase Experiment**: Used bacteriophages to
    confirm that DNA (not proteins) is the genetic material.
-   **1953 - James Watson & Francis Crick (with contributions from
    Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins)**: Discovered the
    **double-helix** structure of DNA.
-   **1961 - Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei**: Cracked the
    genetic code and discovered how DNA directs protein synthesis.

## Structure of DNA

DNA has a **double-helix structure**, resembling a twisted ladder. The
**building blocks** of DNA are nucleotides, which consist of:

#### 1. A phosphate group

#### 2. A deoxyribose sugar (pentose sugar)

#### 3. A nitrogenous base

### Nitrogenous Bases

There are **four** nitrogenous bases:

1.  Adenine (A)
2.  Thymine (T)
3.  Guanine (G)
4.  Cytosine (C)

### Base Pairing Rule (Chargaff’s Rule)

-   Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) → A=T (2 hydrogen bonds)0
-   Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) → G≡C (3 hydrogen bonds)

### DNA Double Helix Features

-   **Backbone**: Made of alternating sugar and phosphate molecules.
-   **Base Pairs**: Form the rungs of the ladder.
-   **Antiparallel Strands**: One strand runs **5’ to 3’**, and the
    other runs **3’ to 5’**.
