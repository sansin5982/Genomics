# DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)

## Introduction

DNA (**Deoxyribonucleic Acid**) is the **fundamental hereditary
material** found in almost all living organisms, including animals,
plants, bacteria, and viruses. It carries the **genetic instructions**
required for the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of
cells. DNA is a **complex biomolecule** composed of **nucleotides**,
which serve as the building blocks of life. These nucleotides are
arranged in a precise sequence to form a **double-helix structure**, a
discovery attributed to **James Watson** and **Francis Crick** in 1953,
based on Rosalind Franklin’s crucial X-ray diffraction data.

DNA plays a central role in biological inheritance, ensuring that traits
are passed from one generation to the next. It serves as a **blueprint**
for the synthesis of proteins, which are essential for the structure and
function of every cell in the body. The ability of DNA to **replicate**
itself allows genetic information to be transmitted accurately during
cell division. However, occasional changes in the DNA sequence, known as
**mutations**, contribute to **genetic diversity** and evolution.

The structure of DNA is **highly conserved** across species, yet the
sequence of nucleotide bases within the DNA molecule determines the
**unique genetic identity** of each organism. With advancements in
genetic research, the study of DNA has led to groundbreaking discoveries
in **medicine, forensics, biotechnology, and evolutionary biology**.
From genetic engineering and gene therapy to DNA fingerprinting, our
understanding of DNA has transformed science and technology, enabling
numerous innovations in healthcare, agriculture, and forensic
investigations.

## History of DNA Discovery

### 1. Early Theories of Heredity

Before DNA was identified as the genetic material, scientists believed
proteins carried genetic information due to their complexity.

### 2. Key Discoveries

-   **1869 - Friedrich Miescher**: Isolated a substance from white blood
    cells, called “nuclein,” later identified as DNA.
-   **1928 - Frederick Griffith**: Conducted experiments with bacteria
    (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and discovered the **“transforming
    principle.”**
-   **1944 - Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty**:
    Identified DNA as the transforming principle.
-   **1952 - Hershey & Chase Experiment**: Used bacteriophages to
    confirm that DNA (not proteins) is the genetic material.
-   **1953 - James Watson & Francis Crick (with contributions from
    Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins)**: Discovered the
    **double-helix** structure of DNA.
-   **1961 - Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei**: Cracked the
    genetic code and discovered how DNA directs protein synthesis.

## Structure of DNA

DNA has a **double-helix structure**, resembling a twisted ladder. The
**building blocks** of DNA are nucleotides, which consist of:

### 1. Phosphate Group

-   The **phosphate group (PO₄)** consists of **one phosphorus atom**
    bonded to **four oxygen atoms**.
-   It is **negatively charged**, making DNA an **acidic molecule**.
-   Phosphate groups are linked to **deoxyribose sugars** through
    **phosphodiester bonds**, forming the **sugar-phosphate backbone**.
-   These bonds connect the **5’ carbon** of one nucleotide’s sugar to
    the **3’ carbon** of the next nucleotide’s sugar, ensuring the
    **directionality** of the DNA strand (5’ to 3’).

#### Function:

-   Provides structural stability to the DNA strand.
-   Maintains DNA’s **negative charge**, which helps in interactions
    with proteins (e.g., histones).
-   Forms the **backbone** of the DNA molecule.

### 2. Deoxyribose Sugar

-   DNA contains a **pentose (5-carbon) sugar** called **deoxyribose**.
-   The name **deoxyribose** comes from the absence of an **oxygen
    atom** on the **2’ carbon**, distinguishing it from **ribose** in
    RNA.

#### Structure of Deoxyribose:

#### Function:

-   Forms the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA.
-   Links nucleotides together via phosphodiester bonds.
-   Supports the attachment of nitrogenous bases.

### Nitrogenous Bases

Despite being incredibly small at the molecular level, DNA carries an
enormous amount of information, encoded in a **four-letter** language
composed of **Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C)**.
These nitrogenous bases follow specific pairing rules (**A with T and G
with C**) to maintain the stability of the double helix. Furthermore,
DNA exists in various structural forms (B-DNA, A-DNA, Z-DNA), allowing
flexibility in biological processes such as **gene expression,
regulation, and repair**.

There are **four** nitrogenous bases classified into **two groups**:

#### A. Purines (Double-ring structure)

-   **Adenine (A)**
-   **Guanine (G)**
-   Larger, **two-ring** molecules.

#### B. Pyrimidines (Single-ring structure)

-   **Cytosine (C)**
-   **Thymine (T)**
-   Smaller, **one-ring** molecules.

### Base Pairing Rule (Chargaff’s Rule)

-   Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) → A=T (2 hydrogen bonds).
-   Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) → G≡C (3 hydrogen bonds).
-   The hydrogen bonds between these bases hold the two DNA strands
    together.

### DNA Double Helix Features

-   **Backbone**: Made of alternating sugar and phosphate molecules.
-   **Base Pairs**: Form the rungs of the ladder.
-   **Antiparallel Strands**: One strand runs **5’ to 3’**, and the
    other runs **3’ to 5’**.

### Function of DNA

-   **Stores Genetic Information**: Carries instructions for protein
    synthesis.
-   **Replication**: Enable complementary base pairing, ensuring
    accurate DNA replication.
-   **Mutation & Evolution**: Changes in DNA lead to genetic diversity.
-   **Gene Expression and Protein Synthesis**: Controls when and how
    genes are turned on or off.

## Types of DNA

DNA can be classified based on its structure, location, and function.

### 1. Based on Structure

DNA exists in **three main structural forms**:

#### A-DNA (Right-Handed Helix)

-   Found in dehydrated conditions.
-   Shorter and wider than B-DNA.
-   Rarely occurs in living cells.

#### B-DNA (Right-Handed Helix)

-   Most common form in living cells.
-   Discovered by Watson and Crick.
-   Has a major groove and minor groove for protein interactions.

#### Z-DNA (Left-Handed Helix)

-   Zigzag backbone structure.
-   Found in regions of DNA undergoing transcription.
-   May play a role in gene regulation.

### 2. Based on Location in Cells

DNA is found in different organelles:

#### Nuclear DNA (nDNA)

-   Located in the **nucleus** of eukaryotic cells.
-   Inherited from both parents.
-   Encodes most of the genetic information.

    photosynthesis.

### 3. Based on Function

#### Coding DNA

-   Contains genes that are transcribed into RNA.
-   Only 1-2% of the human genome is coding DNA.

#### Non-Coding DNA

-   Does not code for proteins but has regulatory roles.
-   Includes **introns, regulatory elements, and repetitive DNA**.

### 4. Based on Organization in the Genome

#### Single-Copy DNA

-   Unique sequences that occur once in the genome.
-   Includes protein-coding genes.

#### Repetitive DNA

-   Sequences repeated many times.
-   Examples:
    -   **Tandem repeats** (e.g., microsatellites, minisatellites).
    -   **Interspersed repeats** (e.g., transposable elements).
