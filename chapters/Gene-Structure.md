# 1. Introduction

Genes are the **fundamental units of heredity**, carrying instructions
that determine an organism’s traits. Understanding **gene structure** is
essential for exploring **genetics, evolution, gene regulation, and
disease mechanisms**.

A gene consists of both **coding (exons)** and **non-coding (introns,
regulatory elements) regions**, playing a vital role in **protein
synthesis and gene expression**. The distinction between these regions
helps scientists decode how genes function, evolve, and contribute to
health and disease.

## Definition of a gene

A **gene** is a segment of DNA that contains the instructions to produce
**a functional product**, typically a protein. However, some genes code
for **functional RNA molecules** (e.g., rRNA, tRNA, miRNA) instead of
proteins.

### Key Features of a Gene:

-   Sequence of nucleotides (**A, T, G, C**)
-   Has a specific location (locus) on a chromosome
-   Encodes a protein or functional RNA
-   Transmitted from parent to offspring
-   Regulated by promoters, enhancers, and other control elements

### Classical vs. Modern Definition:

-   **Classical Definition (Mendelian Genetics)**: A gene is a unit of
    heredity responsible for a trait.
-   **Modern Definition (Molecular Biology)**: A gene is a DNA sequence
    that undergoes **transcription** and produces **a functional RNA or
    protein**.

#### Example:

-   The **HBB gene** codes for **β-globin**, a component of hemoglobin
    in red blood cells.
-   Mutations in the **HBB gene** can lead to **sickle cell anemia**.

## Overview of coding and non-coding DNA

The **human genome** contains approximately **3 billion base pairs**,
but **only ~1-2%** of it is **coding DNA** (responsible for making
proteins). The rest is **non-coding DNA**, which plays crucial
regulatory and structural roles.

### Coding DNA (Exons)

-   **Definition**: Coding DNA consists of **exons**, which are
    transcribed and translated into proteins.
-   **Function**: Directly responsible for protein synthesis.
-   **Composition**: Forms the **Open Reading Frame (ORF)**, a sequence
    that gets translated into amino acids.
-   **Example**: The **TP53 gene**, which encodes the p53 tumor
    suppressor protein, is essential in preventing cancer.

### Non-Coding DNA

Non-coding DNA **does not code for proteins** but plays vital roles in
**gene regulation, genome stability, and evolution**.

#### A. Introns

-   **Non-coding sequences within genes**, transcribed into RNA but
    spliced out before translation.
-   **Function**: Allow for **alternative splicing**, increasing protein
    diversity.
-   **Example**: The **Dystrophin (DMD) gene** has **79 introns**,
    making it one of the largest human genes.

#### B. Regulatory DNA (Enhancers, Promoters, Silencers, Insulators)

-   **Promoters**: Found **upstream of genes**, they control where and
    when a gene is transcribed (e.g., the **TATA box**).
-   **Enhancers & Silencers**: Regulate the **level of gene expression**
    by interacting with transcription factors.
-   **Insulators**: Prevent unwanted interactions between neighboring
    genes.

#### C. Repetitive DNA (Microsatellites, Transposons, Pseudogenes)

-   **Transposable elements (“jumping genes”)**: Mobile DNA sequences
    that influence genome evolution.
-   **Pseudogenes**: “Non-functional” gene copies, remnants of
    **evolutionary history**.
-   **Microsatellites (STRs)**: Short repeated sequences used in
    **forensic DNA profiling**.

#### D. Non-Coding RNAs (ncRNAs)

-   **tRNA & rRNA**: Essential for translation.
-   **miRNA & lncRNA**: Regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.
