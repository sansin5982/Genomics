# DNA Replication

**DNA replication** is the fundamental biological process by which a
cell duplicates its entire genome before cell division. It ensures that
each daughter cell receives an identical copy of genetic information.
This process is semi-conservative, meaning that each newly synthesized
DNA molecule retains one of the original strands and incorporates one
new complementary strand. The accuracy and regulation of this process
are crucial for genetic stability, and errors during replication can
result in mutations, genetic disorders, or cancer.

DNA replication primarily occurs during the **S phase of the cell
cycle** and involves a well-coordinated sequence of molecular events. A
multitude of enzymes and accessory proteins collaborate to unwind the
double helix, stabilize the exposed strands, synthesize complementary
strands, and proofread the newly formed DNA.

### Initiation of Replication

Replication begins at specific locations in the DNA molecule known as
**origins of replication**. In eukaryotes, there are multiple origins
per chromosome to allow rapid duplication. The process starts with the
recognition of these origins by a multi-protein complex.

The **Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)** binds to the DNA and recruits
additional proteins, including **CDC6** and **CDT1**, which help load
the **Mini-Chromosome Maintenance (MCM) complex, a helicase**. This
pre-replicative complex forms during the G1 phase. Activation of the
helicase requires phosphorylation by CDKs and DDK (Dbf4-dependent
kinase), which occurs at the onset of S phase.

### Unwinding the DNA

Once the helicase is activated, it begins to unwind the double-stranded
DNA into two single strands. This creates a replication fork—an active
area where replication occurs.

The enzyme **DNA helicase** (MCM complex in eukaryotes) breaks the
hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide base pairs, separating the two
strands. This unwinding introduces torsional strain ahead of the fork,
which is resolved by **DNA topoisomerase**. In eukaryotes,
**Topoisomerase** I makes transient single-stranded breaks, while
Topoisomerase II (including DNA gyrase in prokaryotes) introduces
transient double-stranded breaks to relieve supercoiling.

To stabilize the single-stranded DNA and prevent re-annealing or
degradation, **single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs)** bind to the
exposed strands. In eukaryotes, the replication protein A (RPA) serves
this function.

### Primer Synthesis

DNA polymerases cannot initiate synthesis de novo; they require a free
3’-OH group. Therefore, the enzyme **primase** synthesizes a short RNA
primer complementary to the DNA template. In eukaryotes, primase is part
of the **DNA polymerase α-primase complex**, which lays down a short
RNA-DNA hybrid primer.

These primers are essential starting points for DNA polymerases to begin
elongation. Each leading strand requires only one primer, while the
lagging strand needs multiple primers—one for each **Okazaki fragment**.

### Elongation: Synthesis of New DNA strands

The enzyme responsible for synthesizing the new DNA strands is DNA
polymerase. In eukaryotes, two key polymerases are involved:

-   **DNA polymerase ε (epsilon)** synthesizes the leading strand
    continuously.
-   **DNA polymerase δ (delta)** synthesizes the lagging strand
    discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.

The two strands of DNA are antiparallel, so synthesis can only occur in
the 5’ to 3’ direction. As a result:

-   The **leading strand** is synthesized continuously in the same
    direction as the replication fork.
-   The **lagging strand** is synthesized in short fragments, known as
    **Okazaki fragments**, in the opposite direction.

These polymerases require a sliding clamp, known as proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) in eukaryotes, to remain attached to the DNA and
ensure processivity. PCNA is loaded onto the DNA by the **replication
factor C (RFC) complex**.

### Removal of primers and ligation

Once DNA synthesis is complete, the RNA primers on the lagging strand
must be removed and replaced with DNA. In eukaryotes, **RNase H** and
**flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1)** remove the RNA primers. DNA polymerase δ
then fills in the gaps with DNA.

Finally, the enzyme **DNA ligase** I seals the nicks between the newly
synthesized DNA fragments, forming a continuous strand. This process
completes the synthesis of both leading and lagging strands.

### Proofreading and error correction

DNA polymerases possess 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity, which enables
them to remove incorrectly paired nucleotides during replication. This
proofreading function enhances the fidelity of DNA replication
significantly.

If mismatches escape the polymerase’s proofreading, they may be
corrected by the **mismatch repair (MMR)** system immediately after
replication. Defects in MMR genes such as MLH1 or MSH2 are associated
with Lynch syndrome, a hereditary form of colorectal cancer.

### Termination of Replication

Replication ends when replication forks converge, or when they reach
chromosome ends (telomeres). In linear chromosomes, special problems
arise at the ends because DNA polymerase cannot completely replicate the
3’ ends of the lagging strand.

This results in progressive shortening of chromosomes with each
division. To counteract this, the enzyme **telomerase** extends the 3’
end of the parental strand by adding repetitive sequences (e.g., TTAGGG
in humans). Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase containing an RNA
template.

Telomerase is highly active in germ cells and stem cells, but largely
inactive in somatic cells. Reactivation of telomerase is commonly
observed in cancer cells, contributing to cellular immortality.

### Clinical Significance and Disease Associations

Errors in DNA replication or mutations in replication-associated genes
can lead to genomic instability and are major contributors to cancer and
other genetic disorders.

-   **Xeroderma pigmentosum**: Caused by defects in nucleotide excision
    repair, patients exhibit extreme sensitivity to UV light.
-   **Bloom syndrome**: Caused by mutations in the BLM helicase gene,
    leading to chromosomal instability.
-   **Werner syndrome**: Associated with defects in WRN helicase,
    leading to premature aging.
-   **Cancer**: Mutations in genes encoding DNA polymerases, mismatch
    repair proteins, or telomerase are frequent in various tumors.
