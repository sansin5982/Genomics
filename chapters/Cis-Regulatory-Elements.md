# Cis-Regulatory Elements (CREs)

## 1. What are Cis-Regulatory Elements?

**Cis-Regulatory Elements (CREs)** or **cis-regulatory modules (CRMs)**
are **non-coding DNA sequences** that control **when, where, and how
much a gene is expressed**. Unlike protein-coding sequences, CREs do not
produce proteins but instead function as **“molecular switches”** that
regulate gene activity.

These elements are called **“cis”** because they are located **on the
same chromosome as the genes they regulate**. They function by
interacting with **transcription factors (TFs)**, **chromatin
remodelers**, and **RNA polymerase** to either activate or repress
transcription. A single TFs may control the expression of many genes
(**pleiotropy**) via binding many CREs. CREs contrast with **trans
regulatory elements**.

CREs are one of several types of functional **regulatory elements**.
**Regulatory elements are binding site of TFs** which involved in gene
regulation. **Histone modification** and/or **DNA methylation** also
play a significant role in transcription. **Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)**
such as **microRNAs (miRNAs)** also control gene activity
**post-transcriptionally**. TFs are proteins that bind to specific DNA
sequences within regulatory regions, controlling the transcription rate
of associated genes.

## 3. Examples of Cis-Regulatory Elements

### A. Promoters (Essential for Transcription Initiation)

-   A **promoter** is a DNA sequence where proteins bind to initiate the
    transcription of a single RNA transcript from the DNA downstream of
    the promoter.

-   Found near the **transcriptional start site (TSS) immediately
    upstream** of a gene (towards the **5\` region** of the **sense
    strand**). TFs are involved in the formation the transcriptional
    complex.

-   Contain specific **motifs** such as **response elements** that
    provide secure binding site for **RNA polymerase and transcription
    factors**.

-   Can be 100-1000 base pairs long, depends on the gene and product of
    transcription.

-   The promoters usually have

-   Examples:

    -   **TATA Box**: A common core promoter element (~25-30 bp upstream
        of TSS).
    -   **GC Box (GGGCGG)**: Found in housekeeping genes.
    -   **CAAT Box**: Found in many eukaryotic genes.

The promoter region is divided into three main components:

#### 1. Core Promoter:

This is the essential region located near the transcription start site,
where general transcription factors and RNA polymerase bind to initiate
transcription. It typically contains conserved elements like the TATA
box or initiator sequences.

#### 2. Proximal Promoter:

Positioned just upstream of the core promoter, the proximal promoter
contains binding sites for specific transcription factors that enhance
or repress transcription. These sites are usually within a few hundred
base pairs of the transcription start site.

#### 3. Distal Promoter:

Located further upstream or even downstream from the gene, distal
promoter elements can be several kilobases away from the transcription
start site. They include enhancers and silencers, which interact with
transcription factors to modulate gene expression over long distances.

Together, these promoter components coordinate the precise regulation of
gene transcription.

complex.
</p>

Within the promoter region, just upstream of the transcription start
site, lies the **TATA box**, a sequence consisting of repeated thymine
and adenine nucleotides (TATA repeats). This region plays a crucial role
in transcription initiation by serving as a binding site for the
**transcription factor TFIID**, which is the first to recognize and
attach to the TATA box. The binding of TFIID recruits additional
transcription factors, including **TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH**,
forming the **transcription initiation complex**. Once this complex is
assembled, **RNA polymerase** binds upstream of the TATA box.
Phosphorylation of RNA polymerase within this complex leads to
conformational changes, activating the transcription initiation process
and positioning the polymerase correctly to begin transcription.
Additionally, a **DNA-bending protein** helps bring distant enhancers
into proximity with the transcription factors and mediator proteins,
facilitating transcription regulation.

Beyond the **general transcription factors**, other **sequence-specific
transcription factors** bind to promoter regions to regulate gene
expression. Unlike general transcription factors, which function at all
promoters, these regulators interact with specific promoter sequences to
control the transcription of particular genes. In the genome, there are
**hundreds of transcription factors**, each recognizing a unique DNA
sequence motif.

When these transcription factors bind to promoter regions just upstream
of a gene on the same chromosome, they are known as **cis-acting
elements**. The specific region where a transcription factor binds is
called the **transcription factor binding site**. These transcription
factors respond to **environmental cues**, directing them to their
binding sites and enabling the transcription of genes required under
specific conditions.

### B. Enhancers (Boost Gene Expression)

-   Can be **upstream, downstream, in introns, or even on a different
    chromosome**.

-   Work by **looping to interact with promoters**.

-   Examples:

    -   **SHH Limb Enhancer (ZRS)** → Regulates **Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)**
        gene, controlling limb development. Mutations cause polydactyly.
    -   **MYC Super-Enhancer** → Drives **high expression of MYC**, a
        key oncogene in cancer.

### C. Silencers (Repress Gene Expression)

-   Bind to **repressor proteins** to prevent transcription.

-   Examples:

    -   **Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Element (NRSE)** → Prevents
        neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal tissues.

### D. Insulators (Block Incorrect Enhancer-Promoter Interactions)

-   **CTCF-binding sites** act as insulators by preventing enhancers
    from activating the wrong gene.

-   Example:

    -   **H19/IGF2 Insulator** → Ensures that **only one of the two
        parental alleles is active**.

### E. Locus Control Regions (LCRs)

-   Ensure **correct spatiotemporal expression** of multiple genes in a
    cluster.

-   Example:

    -   **β-Globin LCR** → Controls **developmental switching of
        hemoglobin genes**

## 4. How Cis-Regulatory Elements Work Together

A gene’s expression is **not controlled by just one CRE** but by a
**network of multiple elements** working in coordination.

For example, **in development**:

-   The **SHH gene** is activated in specific tissues by a **distant
    enhancer (ZRS)**.

-   Its **promoter** ensures transcription starts correctly.

-   **Insulators** prevent unwanted activation in other tissues.

-   If **silencers** are mutated, the gene could be **expressed in the
    wrong location**.
