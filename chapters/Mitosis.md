# Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)

Mitosis is a vital process that ensures the accurate division of the
nucleus and its genetic material. It occurs in somatic cells and results
in two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.
Mitosis is essential for growth, tissue repair, regeneration, and
asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms. Unlike meiosis, which
occurs in germ cells and results in genetic variation, mitosis maintains
the chromosome number of the parent cell and guarantees genetic
stability.

This complex but orderly process is part of the cell cycle and follows
DNA replication in the S phase. The M phase, or mitotic phase, includes
both mitosis and cytokinesis. It is governed by specific enzymes and
checkpoint controls to ensure error-free division.

### THE CELL CYCLE CONTEXT

The cell cycle is divided into four major phases:

-   **G1 Phase (First Gap)**: The cell grows and prepares enzymes and
    nutrients needed for DNA replication.

-   **S Phase (Synthesis)**: The entire genome is replicated. DNA
    polymerase is the major enzyme involved in the replication process.

-   **G2 Phase (Second Gap)**: The cell continues to grow and produce
    proteins and enzymes required for mitosis, including cyclins and
    CDKs.

-   **M Phase (Mitosis and Cytokinesis)**: The cell undergoes nuclear
    division followed by division of the cytoplasm.
