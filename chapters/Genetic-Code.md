# Genetic Code

## Genetic Code: The Blueprint of Protein Synthesis

The **genetic code** is the set of rules by which **information encoded
in DNA or RNA sequences is translated into proteins**. It defines how
sequences of **nucleotide triplets (codons)** in **messenger RNA
(mRNA)** are converted into amino acids, the building blocks of
proteins.

The genetic code is **universal, redundant**, and **specific**, ensuring
accurate protein synthesis across all living organisms.

## 1. Structure of the Genetic Code

### Codons: The Language of mRNA

-   The genetic code is based on **triplets of nucleotides** called
    **codons**.
-   Each **codon consists of three nitrogenous bases** (A, U, G, or C in
    RNA; A, T, G, or C in DNA).
-   Each codon **codes for a specific amino acid** or a stop signal in
    translation.
-   Since there are **4 different nucleotides** and they are read in
    groups of 3, there are **4³ = 64** possible codons.
