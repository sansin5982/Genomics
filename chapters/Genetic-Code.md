# Genetic Code

## Genetic Code: The Blueprint of Protein Synthesis

The **genetic code** is the set of rules by which **information encoded
in DNA or RNA sequences is translated into proteins**. It defines how
sequences of **nucleotide triplets (codons)** in **messenger RNA
(mRNA)** are converted into amino acids, the building blocks of
proteins.

The genetic code is **universal, redundant**, and **specific**, ensuring
accurate protein synthesis across all living organisms.

## 1. Structure of the Genetic Code

### Codons: The Language of mRNA

-   The genetic code is based on **triplets of nucleotides** called
    **codons**.
-   Each **codon consists of three nitrogenous bases** (A, U, G, or C in
    RNA; A, T, G, or C in DNA).
-   Each codon **codes for a specific amino acid** or a stop signal in
    translation.
-   Since there are **4 different nucleotides** and they are read in
    groups of 3, there are **4³ = 64** possible codons.

## 2. Characteristics of the Genetic Code

### 1. Universal

-   The genetic code is almost **identical across all living
    organisms**.
-   This means the same codon **codes for the same amino acid** in
    bacteria, plants, animals, and humans.
-   Example: **AUG always codes for methionine (Met)** in all organisms.

### 2. Redundant (Degenerate)

-   There are **64 codons** but only **20 amino acids**, meaning some
    amino acids are encoded by **more than one codon**.
-   Example:
    -   **Leucine (Leu) is encoded by 6 codons** – UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC,
        CUA, and CUG.
    -   **Serine (Ser) is encoded by 6 codons** – UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG,
        AGU, AGC.
-   This redundancy helps **protect against mutations**.

### 3. Non-Overlapping and Commaless

-   Codons are read in **a continuous sequence** without overlap.
-   Example:
    -   **AUGGCCUAC** is read as **AUG-GCC-UAC**, not **AUG-GCC-CUA**.
-   There are **no spaces or punctuation marks** in the mRNA sequence.

### 4. Specific (Unambiguous)

-   Each codon **always codes for one specific amino acid**.
-   Example: **AUG always codes for methionine** and never for any other
    amino acid.

### 5. Start and Stop Codons

-   There is **one start codon** and **three stop codons** that signal
    the beginning and end of translation.

#### Start codon

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Codon</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Amino Acid</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Function</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>AUG</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Methionine (Met)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Initiates protein synthesis</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

-   The **AUG codon** serves as the **universal start codon**.
-   In **prokaryotes, AUG codes for formyl-methionine (fMet)** instead
    of normal methionine.

#### Stop codon

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Codon</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Function</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>UAA</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Stop codon (no amino acid assigned)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>UAG</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Stop codon (no amino acid assigned)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>UGA</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Stop codon (no amino acid assigned)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

-   Stop codons **signal the end of translation**, causing the ribosome
    to release the newly

## 3. Reading Frame & Frame Shift Mutations

### Reading Frame

-   The sequence of codons in mRNA **must be read in the correct
    “reading frame”** (starting from the correct AUG codon).
-   A shift in the reading frame **can alter the entire amino acid
    sequence**, leading to **nonfunctional proteins**.

### Frameshift Mutations

-   A **frameshift mutation** occurs when nucleotides are inserted or
    deleted, shifting the codon reading frame.
-   Example:
    -   **Normal sequence**: AUG-GCC-AAG-UAC (Met-Ala-Lys-Tyr)
    -   **Insertion of “C”**: AUG-GCC-CAA-GUA-C… (Met-Ala-Gln-Val…) →
        Protein is altered.
    -   **Deletion of “G”**: AUG-CCA-AGU-AC… (Met-Pro-Ser…) → Protein is
        altered.
-   Frameshift mutations often result in nonfunctional or truncated
    proteins, leading to genetic disorders.

## 4. Wobble Hypothesis: How tRNA Recognizes Multiple Codons

-   Since the genetic code is **redundant**, a single **tRNA molecule
    can recognize multiple codons** for the same amino acid.
-   This is explained by the **Wobble Hypothesis**, which states that:
    -   The **third base of the codon** (3′ end of mRNA) and **first
        base of the anticodon** (5′ end of tRNA) have **flexibility** in
        pairing.
    -   This allows **one tRNA to bind to multiple codons**, reducing
        the number of tRNAs needed.

#### Example of Wobble Pairing

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Codon</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">tRNA Anticodon</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Amino Acid</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">CGX (X = U, C, or A)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Alanine (Ala)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## 5. Exceptions to the Universal Genetic Code

While the genetic code is mostly universal, there are **some rare
exceptions**: \* **Mitochondria**: In human mitochondria, **UGA codes
for tryptophan (Trp)** instead of a stop signal. \* **Some protozoa**:
UAG and UAA may code for amino acids instead of being stop codons.

## 6. Importance of the Genetic Code

-   **Foundation of Life**: All living organisms use the genetic code to
    synthesize proteins.
-   **Gene Expression Control**: Mutations in the genetic code can lead
    to diseases like **cancer, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell
    anemia**.
-   **Biotechnology & Medicine**: Genetic engineering, gene therapy, and
    CRISPR-based modifications rely on our understanding of the genetic
    code.
-   **Evolutionary Conservation**: The universality of the code suggests
    a **common origin of life**.
