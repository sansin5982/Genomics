# Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)

RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a nucleic acid similar to DNA but differs in
structure and function. **It plays crucial roles in gene expression,
regulation, and various cellular processes**. Unlike DNA, which
primarily serves as the genetic blueprint, **RNA is involved in
translating and executing genetic instructions**.

## History and Differences from DNA

#### History

-   RNA was first discovered by **Friedrich Miescher** in 1868 along
    with DNA.
-   In the 1930s, researchers realized that RNA played a role in protein
    synthesis.
-   In 1959, Severo Ochoa and Arthur Kornberg won the Nobel Prize for
    discovering the enzymatic synthesis of RNA.
-   The discovery of mRNA (messenger RNA) in 1961 by François Jacob and
    Jacques Monod revealed how genetic information is transmitted from
    DNA to protein synthesis.
-   In the 1980s and beyond, RNA’s catalytic activity (ribozymes) and
    regulatory functions (e.g., miRNA, siRNA) were discovered,
    broadening its biological significance.

## Structure of RNA

RNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid composed of a chain of
nucleotides, each made up of three components:

-   A nitrogenous base
-   A five-carbon sugar (ribose)
-   A phosphate group

### Basic Components of RNA

#### 1. Nitrogenous Bases

RNA includes four bases:

-   Adenine (A)
-   Guanine (G)
-   Cytosine (C)
-   Uracil (U) → Replaces thymine (T) found in DNA

#### Base pairing (if RNA folds upon itself):

-   A pairs with U
-   G pairs with C

RNA can form double-stranded regions (e.g., hairpin loops) by
intramolecular base pairing.

#### 2. Ribose Sugar

-   A **pentose sugar** with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 2′ carbon.
-   This hydroxyl group makes RNA **chemically more reactive and less
    stable** than DNA, which has just a hydrogen (-H) at that position
    (deoxyribose).

#### 3. Phosphate Group

-   Attached to the 5′ carbon of ribose.
-   Connects to the 3′ carbon of the next nucleotide via a
    **phosphodiester bond** → forms the **RNA backbone**.

### Primary Structure

-   Linear sequence of nucleotides (e.g., AUGCGUA…)
-   Direction: **5′ → 3′**

Secondary Structure Though RNA is single-stranded, regions within the
strand can base-pair with complementary sequences.

#### Common secondary structures:

-   Hairpins
-   Stem-loops
-   Bulges
-   Pseudoknots

These structures are **essential for function**, especially in tRNA,
rRNA, and ribozymes.

### Tertiary Structure

-   The **3D shape** formed by folding of the secondary structures via:
    -   Hydrogen bonding
    -   Base stacking
    -   Interaction with metal ions or proteins

Examples: \* **tRNA** folds into an L-shaped 3D structure. \* **rRNA**
adopts complex scaffolding to support ribosome function.

#### Significance of RNA Structure

-   Structure determines function: For example,
    -   mRNA must remain linear for translation
    -   tRNA requires precise folding to deliver amino acids
    -   Ribozymes require specific folding to catalyze reactions
-   Mutations or misfolding can affect RNA stability and function,
    leading to diseases.

## Types of RNA and Their Roles

RNA is categorized into different types based on its function in genetic
and cellular processes.

### 1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)

-   **Role**: Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for
    protein synthesis.
-   **Process**: Transcribed from a gene and later translated into a
    protein.
-   **Application in Genomics**: Used in transcriptomics (RNA
    sequencing) to study gene expression patterns.

### 2. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

-   **Role**: Forms the core of ribosomes, facilitating protein
    synthesis.
-   **Function**: Provides structural and enzymatic support for
    translation.
-   **Application in Genomics**: Studied in phylogenetics and
    metagenomics to understand species relationships.

### 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA)

    mRNA vaccines) and RNA therapeutics (siRNA drugs) are emerging tools
    in medicine.

## Conclusion

RNA is a versatile molecule essential for gene expression, regulation,
and cellular function. Its different types, from mRNA to lncRNA, have
significant roles in genetics and genomics. With advances in RNA
sequencing and therapeutic applications, RNA research continues to
