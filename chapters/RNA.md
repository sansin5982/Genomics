# Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)

RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a nucleic acid similar to DNA but differs in
structure and function. **It plays crucial roles in gene expression,
regulation, and various cellular processes**. Unlike DNA, which
primarily serves as the genetic blueprint, **RNA is involved in
translating and executing genetic instructions**.

## History and Differences from DNA

#### History

-   RNA was first discovered by **Friedrich Miescher** in 1868 along
    with DNA.
-   In the 1930s, researchers realized that RNA played a role in protein
    synthesis.
-   In 1959, Severo Ochoa and Arthur Kornberg won the Nobel Prize for
    discovering the enzymatic synthesis of RNA.
-   The discovery of mRNA (messenger RNA) in 1961 by François Jacob and
    Jacques Monod revealed how genetic information is transmitted from
    DNA to protein synthesis.
-   In the 1980s and beyond, RNA’s catalytic activity (ribozymes) and
    regulatory functions (e.g., miRNA, siRNA) were discovered,
    broadening its biological significance.

## Structure of RNA

RNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid composed of a chain of
nucleotides, each made up of three components:

-   A nitrogenous base
-   A five-carbon sugar (ribose)
-   A phosphate group

### Basic Components of RNA

#### 1. Nitrogenous Bases

RNA includes four bases:

-   Adenine (A)
-   Guanine (G)
-   Cytosine (C)
-   Uracil (U) → Replaces thymine (T) found in DNA

#### Base pairing (if RNA folds upon itself):

-   A pairs with U
-   G pairs with C

RNA can form double-stranded regions (e.g., hairpin loops) by
intramolecular base pairing.

#### 2. Ribose Sugar

-   A **pentose sugar** with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 2′ carbon.
-   This hydroxyl group makes RNA **chemically more reactive and less
    stable** than DNA, which has just a hydrogen (-H) at that position
    (deoxyribose).

#### 3. Phosphate Group

-   Attached to the 5′ carbon of ribose.
-   Connects to the 3′ carbon of the next nucleotide via a
    **phosphodiester bond** → forms the **RNA backbone**.

### Primary Structure

-   Linear sequence of nucleotides (e.g., AUGCGUA…)
-   Direction: **5′ → 3′**

Secondary Structure Though RNA is single-stranded, regions within the
strand can base-pair with complementary sequences.

### Common secondary structures:

-   Hairpins
-   Stem-loops
-   Bulges
-   Pseudoknots

These structures are **essential for function**, especially in tRNA,
rRNA, and ribozymes.

### Tertiary Structure

-   The **3D shape** formed by folding of the secondary structures via:
    -   Hydrogen bonding
    -   Base stacking
    -   Interaction with metal ions or proteins

Examples:

-   **tRNA** folds into an L-shaped 3D structure.
-   **rRNA** adopts complex scaffolding to support ribosome function.

The RNA folding process is hierarchical, i.e., the RNA secondary structure forms rapidly from linear RNA (primary structure) with a large energy loss, while the formation of a complex tertiary structure is usually much slower." width="600" />

#### Significance of RNA Structure

-   Structure determines function: For example,
    -   mRNA must remain linear for translation
    -   tRNA requires precise folding to deliver amino acids
    -   Ribozymes require specific folding to catalyze reactions
-   Mutations or misfolding can affect RNA stability and function,
    leading to diseases.

## Types of RNA and Their Roles

RNA is categorized into different types based on its function in genetic
and cellular processes.

### 1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)

**Messenger RNA (mRNA)** is a type of RNA that **carries genetic
information from DNA** in the nucleus to the **ribosomes** in the
cytoplasm, where it is **translated into protein**. It serves as a
**template** for protein synthesis and is **central to gene
expression**.

<img src="Figures/mRNA formation.png" alt="Figure 5: Central Dogma: Formation of mRNA from DNA" width="125%" height="125%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5: Central Dogma: Formation of mRNA from DNA
</p>

mRNA is **transcribed from DNA** during **transcription**, and then
processed (in eukaryotes) before being translated. **RNA polymerase**
converts the gene into **pre-mRNA**. During **RNA splicing**, introns
are removed, leaving only **exons**. This exon constitutes **mRNA**.
Genetic information in mRNA is contained in the sequence of
**nucleotide**

Instead of **thymine**, mRNA uses **uracil**. Several steps takes place
to form mature mRNA.

-   **Splicing**: Removes **introns** or **outrons** (non coding region)
    from pre-mRNA.

-   **5’ cap addition**: Also known as **RNA cap**, an **RNA
    7-methylguanosine cap** or **RNA m7G cap**. A 5’ cap is a modified
    guanine nucleotide that has been added to the front or 5’ end of
    mRNA. Its presence is critical for recognition by the ribosome and
    protection from RNases.

-   **Polyadenylation**: Polyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a
    polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule. After the mRNA has
    been cleaved, around **250 adenosine residues** are added to the
    free 3’ end at the cleavage site. This reaction is catalyzed by
    polyadenylate polymerase. Protect mRNA from degradation by
    exonuclease.

-   **Coding regions**: Coding regrions are composed of codons which are
    decoded and translated into proteins by the ribosome. Coding regions
    begin with the **start codon (AUG)** and end with a **stop codon
    (UAA, UAG, UGA)**.

-   **Untranslated region (UTR)**: UTRs are sections of the mRNA before
    the start codon and after the stop codon **that are not
    translated**, termed the **five prime untranslated region (5’ UTR)**
    and **three prime untranslated region (3’ UTR)**, respectively.

-   **Poly(A) tail**: The **3’ poly(A) tail** is a long sequence of
    adenine nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the 3’ end of
    the pre-mRNA. This tail promotes export from the nucleus and
    translation, and protects the mRNA from degradation.

#### Structure of mRNA

The structure of a **eukaryotic mRNA molecule** includes several
**functional regions**:

</table>

In prokaryotes, mRNA does not have a 5′ cap or poly(A) tail, and often
encodes multiple proteins (polycistronic).

### Monocistronic versus polycistronic m RNA

Monocistronic mRNA contains the genetic information to translate only a
single protein chain (polypetide). Polycistronic mRNA carries several
**open reading frames**, each of which translated into a polypeptide.
These polypeptides usually have a related functions.

#### Role of mRNA in Genetics and Genomics

#### a. Gene Expression

-   mRNA is the intermediate product between a gene (DNA) and the
    functional product (protein).
-   Gene expression studies (e.g., using RNA-seq) measure mRNA levels to
    understand which genes are active.

#### b. Transcriptomics

-   mRNA is central to transcriptomics, a major field in genomics aimed
    at:
    -   Studying gene expression profiles
    -   Identifying disease biomarkers
    -   Exploring developmental and cellular responses

#### c. Splicing and Isoforms

-   Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA creates **different mRNA isoforms**
    from a single gene → protein diversity.

#### Role of mRNA in Disease

Mutations or misregulation of mRNA can cause diseases in several ways:

-   **Aberrant splicing** → production of dysfunctional proteins. For
    example: Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Beta-Thalassemia
-   **mRNA decay defects** → abnormal accumulation of toxic proteins
-   **Transcriptional dysregulation** → cancer, neurodegeneration

### 2. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

**Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)** is a type of **non-coding** RNA that forms the
**core structural and functional components of the ribosome**, which is
the molecular machine responsible for **protein synthesis**
(translation).

rRNA, along with ribosomal proteins, makes up **ribosomes**, which:

-   Read mRNA sequences.
-   Catalyze the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids.

**rRNA is the most abundant type of RNA in the cell (~80–90% of total
RNA).**

#### Structure of rRNA

#### a. Types of rRNA in Eukaryotes

Eukaryotic ribosomes are **80S**, composed of:

-   **60S large subunit**:

    -   **28S rRNA**
    -   **5.8S rRNA**
    -   **5S rRNA**

-   **40S small subunit**:

    -   **18S rRNA**

#### b. Types of rRNA in Prokaryotes

Prokaryotic ribosomes are **70S**, composed of:

-   **50S large subunit**:

    -   **3S rRNA**
    -   **5S rRNA**

-   **30S small subunit**:

-   **16S rRNA**

#### c. Structural Features

-   rRNAs **fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures** with
    stems, loops, bulges, and helices.
-   These folded structures form the **scaffold** for ribosome assembly
    and are crucial for function.
-   rRNAs **interact with ribosomal proteins** and **mRNA/tRNA** to
    coordinate translation.

**23S (prokaryotic) and 28S (eukaryotic) rRNAs have peptidyl transferase
activity, making them ribozymes**.

#### Role of rRNA in Genetics and Genomics

#### a. Protein Synthesis

-   rRNA is the **catalytic engine** of the ribosome.
-   The **ribosome reads mRNA**, aligns tRNAs, and synthesizes proteins.

#### b. Ribosome Biogenesis

-   rRNAs are **transcribed in the nucleolus** (except 5S rRNA).
-   They undergo **modification and cleavage** before forming mature
    ribosomes.

#### c. rRNA Genes in the Genome

-   rRNA genes exist in **repetitive clusters** called **rDNA** (e.g.,
    45S pre-rRNA genes).
-   Located on **nucleolar organizing regions (NORs)** of specific
    chromosomes (in humans: 13, 14, 15, 21, 22).

#### d. Phylogenetics and Evolution

-   **16S (prokaryotic)** and **18S (eukaryotic)** rRNAs are highly
    conserved.
-   Widely used for **species identification** and **evolutionary
    studies** (e.g., 16S rRNA sequencing in microbiome research).
